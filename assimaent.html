                        trees.
                        This is similar to the behavior of many species of woodpeckers. Bluebirds can typically
                        produce between two and four broods during the spring and summer (March through August
                        in
                        the Northeastern United States). Males identify potential nest sites and try to attract
                        prospective female mates to those nesting sites with special behaviors that include
                        singing
                        and flapping wings, and then placing some material in a nesting box or cavity. If the
                        female
                        accepts the male and the nesting site, she alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs.
